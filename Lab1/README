Change I made to minimize part 4:

For zImage, I rebuilt kernel image after adjusting some configuration. Mostly I disable networking support and some device drivers since
they are main config that takes a lot of space and some of them we don't need it in this assignments such as IP, I2C, SPI, GNSS, etc. (More hardware involvement)

For rootfs.img, after all adjustment from previous step (except busybox),  I run du -sh $WORKSPACE/rootfs to check the actual size of
the folder which result in 14MiB which means we can change the default command when creating the blank disk image from count=128 to 15 then step down
because there are some unused space in folder. I got that when I did count = 12 there is not enough space. Therefore, I used image's size as 13 MiB.

After this, I rub  e2fsck -f rootfs.img and resize2fs -M rootfs.img to shrink filesystem to actual size becasue of some unused space to 12.8 MiB.

The reason why I don't delete in the first place, because I disable a lot of command and support from busy box to free space to 10 MiB but it
appeared that it disabled root login (require password) So I enable defconfig to check, then disable archieve mode, some editors and few commands as possible.
So that other functionalities didn't get affected from this.

And did the same process as before; in conclusion my final minimized size of kernel image (zImage) is 8.0 MiB and size of rootfs.img is 12.5 MiB.

Latest update: I disable some small features on hardware such as USB additionally in kernel linux and it gave the smallest as 11.6 MiB.

Later Update: after asking for an advice from GST, I disabled media support before building new kernel img. Latest 8.7 MiB.
